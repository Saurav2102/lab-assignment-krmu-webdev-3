Project Overview
This project is Lab Assignment 3 for Web Development I.

The goal was to design and build a one-page responsive personal portfolio website.


The website uses advanced CSS techniques to create a polished and interactive layout.

Key Features Implemented
Layout:


Flexbox was used to manage alignment and spacing in the Header and Hero sections.




CSS Grid was applied to structure the Skills and Projects sections.


Responsiveness:

The design is mobile-first and uses media queries to adapt the layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.


Relative units (rem, em, vw, vh) were used for consistent and scalable spacing and font sizing.


Interactivity:


Hover effects and CSS transitions were added to navigation links, buttons, and cards for smooth user interaction.



CSS transforms are used on interactive elements.

How to Test Responsiveness
You can test how the website adapts by resizing your browser window.

The layout adjusts based on the screen width to ensure the content always looks good.

On smaller screens, elements like the Hero text and image will stack vertically, and Grid items will collapse into one column.
